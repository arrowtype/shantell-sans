# ColdType Animations

Uses [ColdType](https://github.com/coldtype/coldtype) to make several animations for demonstrating the variable axes of Shantell Sans.

## Basic build process (subject to change in future versions of ColdType)

Set up the project requirements as specified in the main project [README](https://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans/README.md).

Then, in a command line, with the venv activated, run ColdType like this:

```bash
coldtype "sources/04-coldtype/irregularity.coldtype.py"
```

This will open a little preview window. Click on that and press the **space** key to play it. Press **R** to render the frames, and then press **A** to render the gif.
