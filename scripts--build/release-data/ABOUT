    A variable font containing all font styles in the variable axes
    Weight, Italic, Bounce, Irregularity, and Tracking. Ideal for use in 
    desktop graphic design in apps like Adobe Illustrator if you want to dial 
    in a very specific weight or style. Variable fonts are still a new
    technology, and this may have issues in some software – in particular, there
    may be issues exporting variable fonts to PDFs, so it can be helpful to outline
    variable fonts before exporting.
