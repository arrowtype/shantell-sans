# Shantell Sans

Shantell Sans, from [Shantell Martin](https://shantellmartin.art/), is a marker-style font built for creative expression, typographic play, and animation.

Shantell Sans is a project based on the artwork, handwriting, and creative philosophy of Shantell Martin. Rather than trying to exactly mimick or “replace” Shantell’s writing, Shantell Sans takes inspiration from marker-based fonts like Comic Sans & Inkwell Sans. It aims to create an authetically typographic system with a single core shape per character, in order to deliver a simple, inviting, and energetic tone while encouraging freedom and play.

To download Shantell Sans, [please see the latest release](https://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans/releases) and download the zip file.

### Variable Axes

Shantell’s writing is dynamic and doesn’t adhere to a rigid baseline or precise metrics, so Shantell Sans employs *variable axes* are to reflect this flexibility in a fluid range of styles.

![Axes in Shantell Sans](specimens/shantell_sans-axes.png)

Axis        | Tag    |    Range | Default | Description
:-----------|:-------|---------:|--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weight      | `wght` |  300–800 |     300 | Light to ExtraBold. Can be defined with the `font-weight` CSS property.
Italic      | `ital` |      0–1 |       0 | Upright to Italic. Can be defined with the `font-style` CSS property.
Bounce      | `BNCE` | -100–100 |       0 | Emulates the bouncy baseline of handwriting. Note: [see below](#making-randomization-work-bounce-and-informality-axesstyles) for how to make this fully work in MS Word and Adobe Illustrator.
Informality | `INFM` |    0–100 |       0 | Emulates the irregular shaping and proportions of handwriting.
Spacing     | `SPAC` |    0–100 |       0 | Adds extra spacing to the left and right of each glyph.

Bounce, Informality, and Spacing can be defined in the `font-variation-settings` CSS property. See [this guide to using custom axes in CSS](https://variablefonts.io/about-variable-fonts/#custom) for more information.

### Character set

Shantell Sans supports a wide range of 380+ languages using Latin & Cyrillic scripts, throughout Europe, the Americas, central Asia, and Vietnam.

### OpenType Features

#### User-facing features 

The following features control font options you might wish to adjust in software and via the [CSS property `font-feature-settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings).

Feature                    | Tag    | Description
:--------------------------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case-sensitive punctuation | `case` | Makes punctuation fit cap-height for uppercase typesetting
Arbitrary Fractions        | `frac` | Makes proper fractions from strings like 1/2 and 12/345
Tabular Figures            | `tnum` | Numbers & currencies are monospaced across styles by default to improve table layout, but this makes certain punctuation become tabular as well
Proportional Figures       | `pnum` | Makes numbers take up a natural amount of space
Ordinals                   | `ordn` | Activates ordinals, primarily for Spanish
Superscript                | `sups` | Activates superscript numerals, e.g. for footnotes & exponents
Scientific Inferiors       | `sinf` | Activates subscript/inferior numerals, e.g. for scientific chemical notations
Slashed Zero               | `zero` | Activates a slashed form of zero for higher legibility numbering
Standard Ligatures         | `liga` | Converts 3+ repeated hyphens into wavy lines, just for fun
Stylistic Sets             | `ss0X` | Several stylistic sets exist to help toggle different character forms for Cyrillic languages, as a backup to software-level localization

#### Other features 

Other features are mostly intended to be handled by software and ignored by users.

Feature              | Tag    | Description
:--------------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contexual Alternates | `calt` | On by default; activates a ligature for `її`, used in Ukrainian
Localized Forms      | `locl` | Supports special character-design requirements for various languages (TRK, CAT, ROM, MOL, NLD, BGR, SRB, MKD, UKR, and more)
Required Ligatures   | `rlig` | On by default; adds pseudo-random pattern to alternates in Irregular & Bouncy styles

Also included are `aalt`, `kern`, `ccmp`, `dnom`, `numr`, `mark`, and `mkmk`.

### Making randomization work (Bounce and Informality axes/styles)

In most apps and web browers, the *Bounce* and *Informality* axes and styles automatically apply randomization to text. Specifically, the font will cycle through several alternates of each glyph, to make text more lively and give it a more “handwritten” appearance. Under the hood, this is done via the `rlig` OpenType feature. This should be on by default everywhere, but unfortunately, in some apps you will need to specifically activate this feature.

<details>
<summary><b><!-------->Adobe Illustrator<!--------></b> (Click to expand)</summary>

To use `rlig` in Adobe Illustrator, you must use one of the “Middle Eastern” line composers (as of Illustrator 2023, Version 27).

1. Navigate to Illustrator > Preferences > Type
2. Click the checkbox “Show Indic Options”
3. Then, open the Paragraph panel (Window > Type > Paragraph)
4. Open the hamburger/flyout menu of the Paragraph panel, and select “Middle Eastern & South Asian Every-line Composer”

Note: this is harder than it should be, as `rlig` is supposed to work by default – and does in most apps! If you would like Adobe to improve this, please [go vote ”Critical” on this Adobe Forum Post](https://illustrator.uservoice.com/forums/333657-illustrator-desktop-feature-requests/suggestions/33434134-opentype-ligature-features-ccmp-and-rlig-do-not-wo).

<details>
<summary><b><!-------->Microsoft Word (Windows 11)<!--------></b> (Click to expand)</summary>

1. Search for `Font Settings` in the top search bar.
2. In the ”Advanced” tab, find the ”Ligatures” menu and select **Standard Only**

If you find issues with randomization in other apps (or if you run into any other problems), please [file an issue in this repo](https://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans/issues)!

## Build

<details>
<summary><b><!-------->How to build the fonts locally<!--------></b> (Click to expand)</summary>

### Set up requirements

Make a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate venv:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, give the build scripts permission to run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts--build/*.sh
```

Finally, you will also need to separately install [google/woff2](https://github.com/google/woff2) to enable the `woff2_compress` and `woff2_decompress` commands. Open a new terminal session, window, or tab to do this step.

```bash
# 👉 open a new terminal session first, then run this
git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/woff2.git
cd woff2
make clean all
```

### Building the fonts

```bash
source venv/bin/activate # activate venv if not already active
```

Clean the prior run prep:

```bash
make clean
```

Then, run the variable font build:

```bash
make vf
```

This will take the `.glyphspackage` source and create the folder `sources/build-prep` with intermediate sources required for the final font build. When the build succeeds, the variable font will open in your default font-opening application (I recommend Font Goggles).

If you want, you can also build the static fonts. Be aware: there are a lot of static fonts, so this takes some time!

```bash
make statics
```

If you want to build everything all at once, you can use `make full`. If you just want to run the build prep pipeline, you can use `make prep`.


## Release

Update the version number in `version.txt` to the desired next release number, then build fonts with the `make` workflow described above.

A zipped archive of the fonts folder is created as the final step of the `make statics` command.

Finally, go update the download links in the Shantell Sans web specimen.
