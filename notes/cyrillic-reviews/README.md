# Cyrillic Reviews for Shantell Sans

Throughout the design process of Cyrillic language support in Shantell Sans, by Anya Danilova, we received multiple reviews/critiques from additional experts: Maria Doreuli, Krista Radoeva, and Alexei Vanyashin.

This folder includes marked-up PDFs from them, along with some notes from our conversations, where reviews were carried out via web calls.
