# Character Set Check, 2022-07-05

I’ve checked the latest font build (v1.002 at `ba599a3`), and the only characters not in the font that should be, according to currently GF Latin Plus and GF Cyrillic Plus glyphsets, are:

```

```

Good news: the Cyrillic unicode coverage is all there! We do still need to test that all locl variants are there, but it seems to be very well handled by the Cyrillic contributors.

I will track the additions of the above glyphs at https://github.com/arrowtype/shantell-sans/issues/83.
