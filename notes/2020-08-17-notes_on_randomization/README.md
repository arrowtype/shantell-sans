# Notes on randomization, Aug 17, 2020

I mentioned that I would try to explain how things are working a little more technically, then forgot to. ðŸ˜… Basically:

1. Each character has three versions: think of them as "A.1, A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.3," and so on.

2. ".1" glyphs are randomly shifted up or down, ".2" glyphs are randomly shifted up, and ".3" glyphs are randomly shifted down â€“ but only on the "Bouncy" side of the fontâ€™s overall designspace (its stylistic range, which right now has an axis for Weight and another for Bounce)

3. As you type, the computer tracks code in the font which selects which version of each character to show:
  1. The font starts by placing a character, like A.1
  2. If you type another character after a ".1" glyph, the font then places a ".2" glyph like B.2
  3. If you type a character after a ".2" glyph, the font then places a ".3" glyph like C.3

4. Because of point 2, if you go from Bouncy=0 (where no glyphs are shifted up or down) towards Bouncy=200 (where all glyphs are shifted either up or down), letters go from nice & orderly to nice & wild.

The code that creates the randomly-shifted letters is a little bit complex, but the logic that cycles through letter versions (as described in point 3) is actually surprisingly brief (the type designer & engineer Tal Leming [gets the credit for this approach](http://opentypecookbook.com/common-techniques/)):

When built into a font, this is what results in the pseudo-random behavior, which you can predict in a repeated single character if you know what to look for:

...but is made less predictable by further (bounded) randomization of overall up/down positioning in each character:

...and works together to look fairly unpredictable in most text:

An interesting sidenote: I also experimented with a more-complex, more truly-random approach, but it resulted in something that looked less random because double letters in words like "bookkeeper" ended up repeating at the same height about 33% of the time. To avoid that, it would require many more alternates in the fonts, but this becomes a game of diminishing returns, especially if we want to use this font on the web, where people like to keep font filesizes small. But, I will probably experiment a bit more on the specific approach to randomization, along with some experiments to overall letter proportions as mentioned on our call.
