# Randomization

Basic process to update "organic" sources:

1. Duplicate now-expanded primary UFOs
2. The "organic" sources only had changes to the core A–Z & a–z, so I just copied these into the duplicated primary UFOs
3. Correct UFO names to make things conform to the prior UFO file naming

## Todo

- [ ] make `a` more differently-sized in Organic sources
- [ ] make sure `i` and `j` alts are getting `idotless` & `jdotless` alts (they don’t seem to be)
- [ ] make sure accent components shift along with base components

Maybe
- [ ] look into whether the alts can be avoided for the extended character set ... people don’t need alts for symbols, do they? (maybe...) OR look into subsetting approach.
