TEMPORARY LICENSE - for New Britain Museum of American Art, Oct 14 2020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Permission is hereby granted to Shantell Martin and to the New Britain 
Museum of American Art (NBMAA) to use Shantell Sans for the purposes of 
promotion, wayfinding, and information around the upcoming 2020/2021 
Shantell Martin art show.

These are “Beta” fonts, and not yet completed versions ready for all 
purposes. The “Shantell Sans NBMAA” fonts are provided as-is, with no 
warrantees of any kind. That said, they are built with industry-standard 
tools & processes and should work well in most software. 


BY USING THESE FONTS, YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING USAGE GUIDELINES:

1) The fonts do not have any kerning. This isn’t a critical visual issue 
in Shantell Sans, but where possible (i.e. in Adobe Creative Cloud software), 
you will use “Optical Kerning” be used to improve letter-spacing unless
you specifically need to design a mockup of a design that will be used 
on the web or in other contexts in which Optical Kerning is unavailable. 
(NOTE: In most production fonts, including future versions of Shantell 
Sans, you should instead use “Metric Kerning” to get the kerning designed 
by the type foundry.)

2) The fonts have a fairly wide character set, but it is not yet complete. 
It is possible that some glyphs may appear in a fallback font or with 
“notdef” rectangles. If you see such a problem or something that you are 
unsure about, **you agree to contact Arrow Type with a screenshot or image 
of the problem** so that a fix can be provided if needed. Of the characters 
common to American keyboards, these fonts contain everyting but the following
glyphs: { } \ ` ~ ^ < >. Also currently missing are arrows, as well as some 
characters required for extended European language coverage.

3) If a character is missing and essential for the show, please reach out to
stephen@arrowtype.com, and (if there is time), it will be added to the fonts.

3) If the font is used in running text (e.g. a paragraph of text), it should 
be used with a minimum line-height of 1⅜ (font size * 1.375). For instance, if 
the font is used at 40pt, it should have a line-height (AKA leading) of 55pt 
or greater (40 * 1.375 = 55). For shorter texts (e.g. headlines or logos), you 
can use a minimum line-height of 1 (font size * 1), but you should visually 
check to ensure that characters do not “crash” into one another between lines, 
e.g. as is possible with some combinations of letter descenders and ascenders.

4) The minimum line-height of 1⅜ assumes a maximum line length of about 65 
characters. If you go wider than this, please add more line-height to keep 
things readable.

5) These fonts do not include Italic styles. Instead, typographic emphasis can 
be applied through other means – in particular, by using bolder text styles.
